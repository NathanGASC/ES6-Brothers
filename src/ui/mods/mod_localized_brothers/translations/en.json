And that bastard Hoggart did justice to his name, fleeing like the weasel he is.%SPEECH_ON%What now, captain?%SPEECH_OFF%A voice says from behind. It's %bro2% who sits down beside you, bedding his bloodied axe on his legs. You turn to him to reply, but before you can answer he continues.%SPEECH_ON%Bernhard's dead. They slit his throat. He was a good man and a damn good leader, but all it took was one mistake. That makes you the one in charge now, don't it?%SPEECH_OFF%%bro3% joins the two of you, still breathing heavily. Then %bro1%.%SPEECH_ON%Save the ceremony and anointments for another day. Let's give the men a good burial and return to %townname% to collect our pay. The weasel's men are slain, afterall.

Arrows shooting in from everywhere and nowhere. Men holler and scream, a great volume before death.\n\nAs the hail subsides you draw your weapon with the rest of the men, only to collapse to your knees. An arrow has punctured your side. You shout in pain. A harried glance sees the men charge without you to make a valiant last stand, met in force as steel clashes with steel.\n\nYou meet eyes with the captain, a last nod before his throat is cut. You're left in command now of what few men remain. Trembling in pain you lean on your sword and with all the will you can muster slowly rise again..."
